# Sharing Logistics Simulation
## Getting Started
### About
The goal of the project is to produce a webapp that is able to offer preliminary insight about the viability of a sharing logistics transportation model.
This project is initiative was undertaken by Astone Shi, while the webapp itself was developed by 5 students of the University of Groningen in 2020.

### File structure
This project has been split into 4 folders from the git repository root folder, these are:
* `./application` - contains the root folder of the web app from which the simulation is run.
* `./documentation` - contains all the projects documentation with info about: architecture, design and project requirements.
* `./mockups` - contains mock ups showing how the webapp was expected to look during development phase.
* `./research` - contains preliminary research done from the computations of the simulation in the webapp.

## Running
### Running app
Run the following commands in the application directory in order to run the webapp.
```
npm install
npm run serve
```

## Deployment
### Built With
This project was developed with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
